<h1>Gilded Rose refactoring</h1>

Welcome to my implementation of the gilded rose refactoring kata. The goal of this kata is to refactor the code to make it more readable and easier to maintain.<br><br>
The idea is to first make sure that all the specifications are respected by adding tests on each specification.<br>
Doing so then allows starting the refactor of the implementation of the Gilded Rose.
<br<br><br>
<b>STEPS:</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1- Test all the legacy code (all methods)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2- Refactor the code and always check if the tests work
